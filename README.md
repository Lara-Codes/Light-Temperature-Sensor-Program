# Light-Temperature-Sensor-Program

This program uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2, LEDs, and a DS18B20 temperature sensor. When the temperature goes above 25 Celcius, the LED wired to the corresponding pin on the PI will turn on, and another LED will turn on when the temperature goes below 25 Celcius.
